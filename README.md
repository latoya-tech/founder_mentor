## AI Agent Integration Architecture

This Rails API integrates with a Python-based AI agent that uses Chroma and OpenAI to answer user questions based on The Strategy Files newsletter.

### Why We Use a Microservice Approach

To get a better idea of why I'm using microservices for this project, here is a great article on the topic from 2014: The Clean Code Blog by Robert C. Martin
[Clean Microservice Architecture by Uncle Bob](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/10/01/CleanMicroserviceArchitecture.html)

The AI logic will be a microservice (maybe I'll use FastAPI) Hereâ€™s some benifits:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Python handles AI tasks; Rails handles application logic and data storage.
- **Testability**: Rails tests mock the AI service, keeping specs fast and clean. Python logic is unit-tested separately.
- **Scalability**: The AI service can be independently deployed, scaled, and monitored.
- **Maintainability**: Isolating the AI logic makes it easier to upgrade or swap AI components in the future.

### To Do:
The Rails controller sends a POST request to the AI microservice, receives the generated answer, and handles any needed persistence or user tracking.
